feat(patterns): Complete Pattern System Consolidation (P1-P3)

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Created unified Pattern type in packages/core/src/patterns/types.ts
- Created IPatternRepository interface for storage abstraction
- Created IPatternService interface for consumer API
- Implemented FilePatternRepository, InMemoryPatternRepository, CachedPatternRepository
- Implemented PatternService with caching and business logic
- Created PatternStoreAdapter to bridge legacy PatternStore
- 157 tests for repository/service/adapter

## Phase 2: Consumer Migration (COMPLETE)
- Migrated MCP tools to use IPatternService:
  - drift_patterns_list, drift_pattern_get, drift_status, drift_code_examples
- Migrated CLI commands to use IPatternService:
  - status, approve, ignore, check, files, where, export, report
- Created pattern-service-factory.ts for CLI
- Enterprise server now creates PatternService by default

## Phase 3: Storage Consolidation (COMPLETE)
- Created UnifiedFilePatternRepository with category-based storage
- New storage format: .drift/patterns/{category}.json (v2.0)
  - Status tracked per-pattern (not per-directory)
  - Incremental saves (only dirty categories)
  - Auto-migration from legacy format
- Created repository factory (createPatternRepository) for auto-detection
- Created CLI command: drift migrate-storage
  - --dry-run, --backup, --keep-legacy options
  - rollback and status subcommands
- Added deprecation warnings to legacy stores:
  - PatternStore, PatternShardStore, FilePatternRepository

## New Features: Agent Skills System
- Created drift skills CLI command for managing Agent Skills
  - drift skills list - List available skills with category/time info
  - drift skills install <name> - Install skills to .github/skills/
  - drift skills info <name> - Show skill details and preview
  - drift skills search <query> - Search skills by keyword
  - drift skills uninstall <name> - Remove installed skills
- Added 24 production-ready Agent Skills in skills/ directory:
  - Resilience: circuit-breaker, graceful-degradation
  - API: rate-limiting, idempotency, api-versioning, file-uploads,
         pagination, request-validation, error-handling
  - Auth & Security: jwt-auth, row-level-security, oauth-social-login,
                     webhook-security, audit-logging
  - Integrations: stripe-integration, email-service
  - Workers: background-jobs
  - Performance: caching-strategies
  - Database: database-migrations, soft-delete
  - Foundations: feature-flags, sse-streaming, multi-tenancy
  - Operations: health-checks
- Each skill includes:
  - YAML frontmatter (name, description, category, time estimate)
  - TypeScript and Python implementations
  - Best practices and common mistakes
  - Usage examples and integration guides
- Skills follow the Agent Skills open standard (agentskills.io)

## Test Results
- 2249 tests passing (29 new for unified repository)
- All packages compile successfully

BREAKING CHANGE: None - all changes are backward compatible.
Legacy storage format is auto-migrated on first use.
